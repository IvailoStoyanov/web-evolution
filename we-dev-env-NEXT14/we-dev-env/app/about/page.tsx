              During his university years Ivaylo was also the winner of Oâ€™REILLY
              Web Design Competition 2018 where students were critiqued by
              number of web professionals on their coursework. The external
              judges were asked to rate according to the current, highest web
              standards and we at Web Evolution strictly obide by them whilst
              keeping things new and robust through a build process with the
              latest frameworks.

            We at Web Evolution believe that the best work grows from a
            foundation of respect, open-mindedness, passion and a dose of
            realism guided by a good structure. We want to solve the problems
            over choosing predefined solutions, that is why we like to spend
            more time to get to know your business. Yes it can feel like a step
            back, but it often delivers a better otucome.
