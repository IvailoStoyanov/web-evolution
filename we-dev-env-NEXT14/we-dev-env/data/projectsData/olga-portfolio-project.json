We had just one conversation and he already had a very close vision about how everything is going to look like and how it would work. I am very pleased and highly satisfied with all the work he did and thanks to him the site is even better than I’ve ever imagined.",

    "projectBrief": [
      "Just graduating from university as an architect Olga Golant wanted to stand out. She didnt want to be just another CV in her potential employer’s mailbox but much rather show dedication, talent and willingness to experiment straight out the door.",
      "Olga asked us to create designs for how to display the information to her employers in a clean and exiting way. We needed to make sure there were leading projects she was most proud but at the same time maintain the level of importance on others."
    ],
    "projectApproach": [
      "We started off with a couple of sessions to get a clearer idea of the ideal employer and potential target of the website. From there we needed to settle down on the best possible content for each project. What to show on the website and what to keep for the interview. ",
      "Wireframing the existing data gave us an easy way to test how the user will react to the layout before initiating design and development. ",
      "From there with the newly collected data we had to find the right technology to tackle the build process. Because of the layout similarity required for her work and the scale of the project we decided that a statically generated website will be a perfect fit to display the content  and by using React components it would be easier to maintain down the road."
