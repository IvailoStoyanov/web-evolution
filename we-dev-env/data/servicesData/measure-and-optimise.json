When talking about SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) you need to focus on a lot more than just the headlines and title of the website. Search engines even go as far as semantics when it comes to bringing your website on top.",

Well there is a reason as to why the job exists, there are a lot of layouts out there that confuse, discourage and leave people in the blind and we can help you to avoid being one of them through wireframing, user testing and a mobile first approach.",
